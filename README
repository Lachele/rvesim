This program simulates rovibronic(*) spectra for diatomic molecules and 
attempts to mimic the exact output from any specific spectrometer.

(*) The term rovibronic is a portmanteau of 'rotational, vibrational, 
electronic' and refers to spectra arising from a combination of those three
types of energetic change.  

To learn more about how the program works and why anyone might care, please
see my disseration, contained in the 'doc' dirctory.  For information on the 
program itself, please see Chapter 6.  For examples of use, see Chapter 4.  
For details of theory and experimental method, see Chapters 1-3.  

If you use it, please let me know!
